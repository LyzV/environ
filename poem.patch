 Great fleas have little fleas
 	upon their backs to bite 'em,
-And lettle fleas have lesser fleas,
+and lettle fleat have lesser fleas,
 	and so ad infinitum.
 And the great fleas themselves, in turn,
-	have greater fleas to go on;
-While these again have greater still,
+	have greatr fleas to go on;
+while these again have greater still,
 	and greater still, and so on.
